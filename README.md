## Task
To build a website that reports the weather in a user's location, utilising Google's location API and Darksky’s weather API. Also develop the website with HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap and vanilla JavaScript ES6+.

## Summary
I chose to develop a weather report website, to improve my knowledge and understanding of API’s using google's location API and Darksky’s weather API.

## Functionality
<ul>
    <li> The user is able to select hourly or weekly tables to view the conditions.</li>
<li> The site updates, time, location address, temperature, date, precipitation, humidity, winds and image’s change depending on weather conditions</li>
</ul>

## Design
This design is simplistic showing the  temperature with conditions displayed within a easy to read table and images that reflect the current weather state.
